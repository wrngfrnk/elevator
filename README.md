Elevator.js: quick and simple solution to the Elevator Saga game. Uses only documented API methods. Can complete levels 1 to 9, as well as 16, though it might require a few attempts (read: luck). 

Alternate.js: more complex solution that extends the API a little bit. Works okay at best with one elevator, but gets very messy very fast with more than that. Can reliably complete challenges 1 to 5.
